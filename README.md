This was written completely independently by a third party.

This packages provides a flexible API to the
[Oanda v20 API](http://developer.oanda.com).

The API is being developed as needed, so only a few REST endpoints
are actually available yet.

This software builds on ideas from:

* https://github.com/AwolDes/goanda (which is missing some parameters
in its API calls)

* https://github.com/santegoeds/oanda (which uses Oanda's v1 API,
 and is also archived)

* https://github.com/hootnot/oanda-api-v20 (a Python client)

* https://github.com/oanda/v20-python-samples (Oanda's Python samples)
